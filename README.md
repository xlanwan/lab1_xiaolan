# Lab report

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

Once all changes are done, upload a link to your repository in Canvas
(only one team member needs to do this).
